# Drag and drop demo
This app is a project to demonstrate my abilities developing apps.
[Live application here](www.javi.page/drag-drop-demo/)

### Features
  - Ability to sort images by dragging and dropping.
  - Infinite scrolling to paginate images.
  - Displays details of image by hover event.

## Setup & Development server

Please make sure you have [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli#installing-angular-cli) installed.
```sh
$ cd drap-drop-demo
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Tech
This project was built with Angular and Typescript. There is no specific reason why I chose Angular over other JS framework, I feel more comfortable since I have been working with it in the last years.
However I'm able to develop it in other frameworks if that is a requiment.
